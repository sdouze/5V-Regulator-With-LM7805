# 5V Regulator using LM7805

I built this because I wanted to power a 5V Fan using 12V power supply.
It is a simple circuit but I decided to make schematic and design a PCB for practice.

From this project I learned how to use a LM7805 voltage regulator and also practiced schematic and pcb design in KiCad
